# DVD Rental Aanlysis 🎬 📊

### Project Overview
The DVD Rental Database is a widely used dataset for learning database management and SQL analytics. This project aims to extract actionable insights from the database by leveraging PostgreSQL for data querying and Tableau for data visualization. By analyzing rental trends, customer behavior, and revenue performance, we can make strategic business recommendations to enhance operations and profitability.

This analysis covers various aspects, including customer spending habits, rental trends over time, and the financial performance of different movie categories. The insights derived will help in optimizing inventory management, improving customer engagement, and identifying potential areas for revenue growth.

Additionally, this project serves as a demonstration of data analytics skills, including:

- Database querying with SQL

- Data visualization using Tableau

Business intelligence reporting

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data preparation

GitHub documentation for showcasing technical projects

By the end of this project, stakeholders will have a better understanding of the key drivers behind the business performance of a DVD rental store, enabling them to make data-driven decisions that improve customer satisfaction and financial outcomes.

This project analyzes the DVD Rental Database to extract valuable business insights. Using PostgreSQL for querying, Tableau for visualization, and GitHub for documentation, we uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, rental patterns, and movie performance.
